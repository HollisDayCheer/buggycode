This is an example using two fragments and some listeners. 

We are talking between to fragments here, but if you notice, we only have 1 fragment file. This is because I am implementing two fragment objects in my MainActivity and programatically adding them to the web page. So while I only have 1 type of fragment I have to objects of that fragment that are talking to each other.
